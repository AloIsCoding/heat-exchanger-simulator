# Heat Exchanger Simulator ðŸ§ª

# Overview
This project is a Python-based heat exchanger simulator.  
It models the thermal exchanges between two fluids using principles of heat transfer and fluid dynamics.
This is designed to simplify the calculations of different quantities, at the end for students in chemistry and chemical engineering but also speed up some tedious passages for data analysis in this system.

# Authors
Three authors contributed to this project:
Robin Elkaim, BSc in chemistry and chemical engineering at EPFL 
RomÃ©o Bedague, BSc in chemistry and chemical engineering at EPFL 
AloÃ¯sse Dantant-Cochet, BSc in chemistry and chemical engineering at EPFL 

# Functionalities
This program allows to calculate 4 major impact of heat exchangers:
The flow rate of the cold fluid, 
The flow rate of the hot fluid,
The current Counter/Parallel comparison,
The nature of the fluids used.

For this important quantities related to the heat transfer are calculated and transmitted to the user thanks to a lab report in LaTeX downloadable in pdf and recordable where the user wants it.
