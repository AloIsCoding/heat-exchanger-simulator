    "## Goal of the Project\n",
    "This package was created as a collaborative project for the EPFL course *Practical programming in chemistry*.\n",
    "The objective of this project was to go beyond the scope of the chemical engineering lab sessions (TPs). In one of our lab sessions, we studied a heat exchanger and compared co-current and counter-current configurations. As aspiring chemical engineers, we recognize the critical importance of mastering heat exchangers in industrial processes. In fact, the heat exchanger is one if not the essential machine in the industry, which is why we decided on this one. \n",
    "Therefore, we aimed to develop a pedagogical tool to deepen the understanding of heat exchanger behavior, using the *Introduction to Transport Phenomena* EPFL course as a support. \n",
    "This project provides an interactive simulation tool that allows users to customize a heat exchanger almost from scratch, adjusting parameters such as dimensions, materials, flow rates, and heat transfer fluids. The tool generates lab reports to facilitate learning and analysis. To achieve this, we created:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A graphical user interface (GUI) where users can select a lab session (TP) and configure the heat exchanger parameters.\n",
    "- A database file containing properties of fluids and materials.\n",
    "- A set of functions to perform the simulations.\n",
    "- A feature to generate downloadable lab reports, pre-filled with initial results to allow users to focus on analyzing and optimizing the heat exchanger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the tool's capabilities and provides an example simulation."

    "## Project Structure\n",
    "This program uses an interface to calculate the key parameters of a heat exchanger. There are four modules to do this:\n",
    "- The impact of the cold fluid flow rate on the outlet temperature (TP1).\n",
    "- The impact of the hot fluid temperature on the outlet temperature (TP2).\n",
    "- The impact of the choice of fluids on temperatures (TP3).\n",
    "- The impact of pipe dimensions and composition (TP4).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, the project consists of the following components:\n",
    "- **GUI (interface.py)**: A graphical interface built with Tkinter where users select the lab session and input parameters like dimensions, materials, flow rates, and fluids.\n",
    "- **Data File (utils.py)**: A file containing thermophysical properties of fluids (e.g., water, oil) and materials (e.g., copper, steel).\n",
    "- **Core Functions (core.py)**: A Python module with functions to simulate heat exchanger performance (e.g., heat transfer rates, temperature profiles) for co-current and counter-current configurations.\n",
    "- **Report Generator (report.py)**: A script in LaTeX to produce lab reports, including simulation results and placeholders for further analysis."

    "### Heat Transfer Calculation\n",
    "The central calculations involve heat received and heat transferred, which describe the quantity of heat, the essence of a heat exchanger. We created a dictionary linking the names of the main fluids used in heat exchangers and their thermal capacity (Cp) to simplify user interaction and avoid manual searches."

    "## Analysis and Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges Encountered\n",
    "The development of this heat exchanger simulation tool presented several significant challenges, reflecting both the technical complexity of the project and the learning curve associated with creating a user-friendly, robust application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculation of U**: The U function created a lot of problems because it links a lot of non-constant data together, especially in a cylindrical system like a pipe. Furthermore, to calculate it, convection coefficients are required, which are a mix of many parameters. In fact, in the course we used as a support, these are systematically given in the statements; we don't have precise formulas for it. Thus, additional research oriented by the TEs and Prof. Buonsanti was conducted with the aim of having the most accurate simulation possible. Despite this, the formulas remain complex, and approximations had to be made based on the formulas given in the reference books. Moreover, we have no information regarding the precise boundary between laminar and turbulent regime, which is not a fixed value in the literature, so an arbitrary value was chosen: 5000. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **GUI Development**: Designing an intuitive and robust graphical user interface with Tkinter was a major hurdle. One of the biggest difficulties was anticipating the needs of users who are unfamiliar with the underlying code or even the principles of heat exchangers. Creating an interface that feels \"intuitive\" for novices required us to make assumptions about user behavior without access to direct user testing or feedback, which made it hard to predict what would be clear or confusing. For example, deciding how to label input fields, organize dropdown menus, or display the schematic in a way that communicates the system’s behavior was a constant challenge. Additionally, ensuring the interface dynamically updates the schematic based on user inputs and handles exceptions (e.g., non-numeric or unrealistic inputs like negative temperatures) required extensive error handling. Maintaining a responsive layout across the four TPs, each with slightly different input requirements, further complicated the design process, as we had to balance flexibility with simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Report Generation**: Integrating LaTeX report generation via `report.py` was technically demanding. Ensuring compatibility with MiKTeX across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) was not trivial, as file paths and compiler configurations varied. The dynamic inclusion of simulation results and plots in the LaTeX template required precise string formatting to avoid compilation errors, which were often cryptic and time-consuming to debug. Moreover, testing the report generation process was particularly tedious. Each test required running a full simulation, generating the LaTeX file, compiling it with `pdflatex`, and checking the output PDF for errors or formatting issues. This iterative process was slow, especially when debugging small issues like misaligned plots or missing parameters, and it often felt like a bottleneck in the development cycle. The lack of immediate feedback during testing made it harder to identify the root cause of errors quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Accuracy**: The thermophysical properties in `utils.py` (e.g., viscosity, thermal conductivity, specific heat) are simplified and valid only at specific conditions, such as 20°C for water. This assumption limits the realism of the simulation when parameters like temperature or pressure vary significantly, as real-world fluid properties are temperature- and pressure-dependent. Incorporating a more comprehensive database or a library like CoolProp would have required significant additional effort and was beyond the scope of this project, but the simplification introduced uncertainties that were difficult to quantify without experimental validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Module Integration**: Coordinating the various modules (`core.py`, `interface.py`, `report.py`, `utils.py`, `plotting.py`) was a significant challenge. Each module was developed somewhat independently, and ensuring they worked seamlessly together required careful management of data flow and function interfaces. For example, the simulation results from `core.py` needed to be correctly formatted for both the GUI display in `interface.py` and the LaTeX report in `report.py`. Mismatches in data types, units, or parameter names between modules led to errors that were time-consuming to trace, especially since the integration issues often only became apparent during full system tests. This highlighted the importance of defining clear interfaces and consistent data structures early in the project, which we learned through trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges underscored the complexity of building a cohesive simulation tool and taught us valuable lessons about software design, user experience, and the balance between theoretical accuracy and practical implementation."

    "### Limitations\n",
    "The complete package has a few limitations:\n",
    "- **Flow Regime Boundary**: The boundary between laminar and turbulent flow (Re = 5000) is a simplification. In reality, regimes lie between the two, but are very complex to define, and therefore even more to understand and code. This goes well beyond the course used as a support. That is why it would be interesting to resume this program later, when we have more knowledge.\n",
    "- **Limited Fluid Database**: The list of fluids and materials is limited to a few common options. Expanding the database to include more fluids (e.g., refrigerants, oils) or using a library like CoolProp for temperature-dependent properties would improve accuracy.\n",
    "- **Simplified Models**: The convection coefficient calculations use simplified correlations (e.g., Nusselt number for laminar flow assumes constant wall temperature). Real-world heat exchangers may involve fouling, non-uniform flows, or phase changes, which are not modeled.\n",
    "- **GUI Constraints**: The GUI does not support real-time visualization of results during parameter changes, which could enhance interactivity. Additionally, input validation could be stricter to prevent unrealistic values (e.g., negative temperatures).\n",
    "- **Report Customization**: The LaTeX report is static in structure. Allowing users to customize sections or add comments would make it more flexible for educational or professional use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvements could include integrating machine learning to fetch fluid properties from online databases or enhancing the GUI with real-time plotting using Matplotlib's interactive mode.\n"
