    "## Goal of the Project\n",
    "This package was created as a collaborative project for the EPFL course Practical programming in chemistry.\n",
    "The objective of this project was to go beyond the scope of the chemical engineering lab sessions (TPs). In one of our lab sessions, we studied a heat exchanger and compared co-current and counter-current configurations. As aspiring chemical engineers, we recognize the critical importance of mastering heat exchangers in industrial processes. In fact, the heat exchanger is one if not the essential machine in the industry, which is why we decided on this one. \n",
    "Therefore, we aimed to develop a pedagogical tool to deepen the understanding of heat exchanger behavior, using the Introduction to Transport Phenomena EPFL course as a support. \n",
    "This project provides an interactive simulation tool that allows users to customize a heat exchanger almost from scratch, adjusting parameters such as dimensions, materials, flow rates, and heat transfer fluids. The tool generates lab reports to facilitate learning and analysis. To achieve this, we created:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A graphical user interface where users can select a lab session (TP) and configure the heat exchanger parameters.\n",
    "- A database file containing properties of fluids and materials.\n",
    "- A set of functions to perform the simulations.\n",
    "- A feature to generate downloadable lab reports, pre-filled with initial results to allow users to focus on analyzing and optimizing the heat exchanger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the tool's capabilities and provides an example simulation."

    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This program uses an interface to calculate the key parameters of a heat exchanger. There are 4 modules to do this: \n",
    "The impact of the cold fluid flow rate on the outlet temperature,\n",
    "The impact of the hot fluid on the outlet temperature, \n",
    "The impact of the choice of fluids on temperatures,\n",
    "The impact of pipe dimensions and composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, the project consists of the following components:\n",
    "- GUI (interface.py) : A graphical interface (e.g., built with Tkinter or PyQt) where users select the lab session and input parameters like dimensions, materials, flow rates, and fluids.\n",
    "- Data File (utils.py): A file  containing thermophysical properties of fluids (e.g., water, oil) and materials (e.g., copper, steel).\n",
    "- Core Functions (core.py) : A Python module with functions to simulate heat exchanger performance (e.g., heat transfer rates, temperature profiles) for co-current and counter-current configurations.\n",
    "- Report Generator (report.py) : A script in LaTeX to produce lab reports, including simulation results and placeholders for further analysis."

    "This programme can therefore use certain easily observable and measurable data to calculate many other quantities. The aim of this section is to review these possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, the central one develops into two similar programmes: heat received and heat transferred. Although simple, these are of crucial importance because they describe the quantity of heat, which is the essence of a heat exchanger. \n",
    "For the first, we have created a dictionary linking the names of the main fluids used in heat exchangers and their thermal capacity (Cp) in order to make it easier for the user to use them and avoid having to search for them.  "

Furthermore, to calculate it, convection coefficients are required, which are a mix of many parameters. In fact, in the course we used as a support, these are systematically given in the statements; we don't have precise formulas for it. Thus, additional research oriented by the TEs and Prof. Buonsanti was conducted with the aim of having the most accurate simulation possible. Despite this, the formulas remain complex, and approximations had to be made based on the formulas given in the reference books.Moreover, we have no information regarding the precise boundary between laminar and turbulent regime, which is not a fixed value in the literature, so an arbitrary value was chosen: . \n",
